## BayWheels-Project

I wanted to visualize how bike share traffic in SF changed around COVID-19. Using publicly available data from Lyft's BayWheels program, I mapped the number of rides initiated by zip code by week for 2020. 

### Data Import
- Pull in CSVs for January - June 2020 into One DataFrame
- Import Jan - Mar files into DataFrame
- Map Apr - Jun data to Q1 format into DataFrame
- Concatenate the 2 Dataframes (inner)

### Data Cleaning
- Update 24 records starting at 16th St Fleet Depot from (0,0) to NaN. 
- Remove partial weeks at beginning/end of data set
- Adding additional date fields (first day of week, week number)
- Creating binary COVID variable (<3/16/20 --> COVID=0 ; >=3/16/20 --> COVID=1)

### Create GeoPanda
- Transform start coordinates into coordinates geometry format
- Create GeoPanda

### Map Rides to Zip Codes
- Import Bay Area Zip Shape File
- sjoin with DataFrame
- Restrict to SF Zip Codes

### Basic Information on Behavior Pre/Post COVID-19
- Top Stations
- # of Rides by Week
- # of Rides by Day of Week
- Rides by Week by Zip Code

### GIF Creation
- Create images of rides by week by zip code
- Create GIF in CL using ImageMagick
